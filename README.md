# Bulb Frontend Developer Coding Challenge

## Overview

Thank you for interviewing at Bulb and taking the time to complete this coding exercise.

We expect the challenge to take around 2 hours, however feel free to take as long as you need.

Please approach this as you would a production problem with respect to quality and consider that we will ask you to extend your work in a pairing exercise as part of the technical interview.

The instructions can be found in this README file, but also feel free to email through any questions.

In this challenge, we are looking at an update to an existing design to a page https://www.figma.com/file/cKzce2abhHwuY3c7TGCC3g8l/FED-task

We've setup a basic [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with a basic implementation of the original design and would like you to implement the design update.

The challenge is setup using create react app with typescript under the folder `./ts-energy-usage`, we've disabled strict typechecking, and have also set it up to accept plain javascript and jsx files if you prefer to code without typescript.

We've also aded a simplified version of our public design system Solar, which has some limited documentation at https://bulbenergy.github.io/design-test/index.html#/patterns/styles/colors/README.md.

Feel free to use this.

## We would like you to:

- Implement the new design from https://www.figma.com/file/cKzce2abhHwuY3c7TGCC3g8l/FED-task,
- Not worry about pixel perfection, feel free to make judgement decisions about the implementation
- Feel free to add features to the implementation

- Add your name and how much time you spent on the exercise to [CANDIDATE-NOTES.md](CANDIDATE-NOTES.md).
- Add some notes explaining your approach to [CANDIDATE-NOTES.md](CANDIDATE-NOTES.md).

We do **not** want you to spend time on:

- Changing how the application is bundled and run,
- Setting up a new linter or code formating tool (we used prettier when setting this up so feel free to use that),

**This task should take you roughly 2 hours.**
